# Flock Behavior
Able to Alignment, Coherence, and Separation

# Additional object tyoes within the scene
Stones and a wood with some grass on the grounds.
There is a sand ground. When the fishes run into the sand ground, they will turn back.

# Artist statement
I was trying to implement attract when the user input a food into the canvas, the fish will be able to swim towards to the object. I didn't achieve that because I found that was diffcult.
